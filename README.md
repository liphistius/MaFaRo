# MaFaRo
Many Faced Robot - Open source, modular and parametrically editable robot head.
A Parametric Reconfigurable and Modular Development Platform - Through modularity and tool-less design, the skull allows swapping audio-visual sensors and external interactive interfaces. The design novelty is in being the first truly open-source, parametric head through FreeCAD. It offers integration with other CAD programs, an almost limitless customization options for industry, research and hobbyists through dimensional modification.
